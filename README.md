# 👋 Week 0 – Introduction to Lab Assignments

Welcome to the first lab of *MEE 207 Fundamentals of Programming*.  
This week you will learn basics of Github and how to use GitHub Classroom and submit your assignments.

## 📌 Why GitHub?
- Git is a tool to **track changes** in your code. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. 
- GitHub is an **online platform** where you store and share your Git projects.  
- In this course, you will use GitHub to **receive lab templates** and **submit your solutions**.

## 📂 Key Terms
- **Repository (repo):** A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history.  You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.
- **Clone:** When a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the cloud. With cloning you can make a local copy of the repository on your computer.  
- **Commit:** Save a snapshot of your changes with a short message.  
- **Push:** Upload your committed changes to GitHub.

## 🚀 Submitting Your Work

You can submit your lab assignments in two ways:  

### 1. Using Visual Studio (Enterprise)
1. Accept the assignment link shared by your instructor.  
2. Open **Visual Studio Enterprise** → *Clone a repository*.  
3. Paste the repository link from GitHub Classroom.  
4. Make your changes (e.g., create or edit files).  
5. From the *Git* menu, click **Commit All and Push**.  
6. Go to GitHub and confirm that your files appear in the repository.  

### 2. Using GitHub Web
1. Open your assignment repository on GitHub.  
2. Click **Add file → Create new file** or **Upload files**.  
3. Add or edit your file (e.g., `main.c`).  
4. Write a short **commit message** (e.g., “added main.c”).  
5. Click **Commit changes**.  
6. Refresh your repository page to check your submission.

Your program should:  
- Print your **9-digit student number** on the first line.  
- Print your **first and last name** on the second line.
